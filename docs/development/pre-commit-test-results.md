# Pre-commit Test Results

## Test Summary

We successfully tested the pre-commit hooks with a deliberately bad Python file. Here's what we learned:

### Working Hooks

1. **Automatic Formatters** (These fix issues automatically):
   - ✅ **trailing-whitespace**: Removed trailing spaces
   - ✅ **end-of-file-fixer**: Added newline at end of file
   - ✅ **black**: Reformatted code to standard style
   - ✅ **isort**: Would sort imports (already sorted in test)

2. **Linters** (These report issues):
   - ✅ **flake8**: Found unused import (`F401 'os' imported but unused`)
   - ✅ **bandit**: Found security issues (binding to 0.0.0.0)
   - ✅ **mypy**: Passed (surprisingly lenient in default config)

3. **Custom Checks**:
   - ✅ **check-hardcoded-constants**: Found 34 violations across the codebase
   - ✅ **verify-constants-imports**: Found 3 files with missing imports

### Key Findings

1. **Automatic fixes are applied** - Black, trailing whitespace, and end-of-file fixes are applied automatically, but you still need to stage the changes.

2. **Failing checks block commits** - If any check fails (like flake8 or our custom checks), the commit is blocked.

3. **Comprehensive coverage** - The hooks check:
   - `dns_proxy/` - Main source code
   - `tests/` - Test files
   - `scripts/` - Utility scripts

4. **Current violations** - The codebase has existing violations that need to be fixed:
   - Hardcoded constants in many files
   - Missing imports for constants
   - Security warnings about binding to 0.0.0.0

### How Pre-commit Works

1. When you `git commit`, pre-commit runs automatically
2. It only checks files that are staged for commit
3. Some hooks fix issues automatically (formatting)
4. Other hooks just report issues (linting, custom checks)
5. If any check fails, the commit is aborted
6. You must fix issues or use `--no-verify` to skip

### Next Steps

1. **Fix existing violations** gradually:
   ```bash
   # See all current issues
   ./scripts/run_pre_commit.sh run --all-files
   
   # Fix specific types
   ./scripts/run_pre_commit.sh run black --all-files  # Auto-format
   ./scripts/run_pre_commit.sh run isort --all-files  # Sort imports
   ```

2. **Address security warnings** about 0.0.0.0 binding

3. **Fix hardcoded constants** in the identified files

4. **Add missing imports** for constants

The pre-commit setup is working correctly and will help maintain code quality going forward!
