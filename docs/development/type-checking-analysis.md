# Type Checking Analysis

## Current State (Permissive Mode)

With the current permissive mypy configuration:
- `disallow_untyped_defs = False` (functions don't need type hints)
- `--no-strict-optional` (lenient about None types)
- Special relaxation for `tests/` and `scripts/`

Result: **0 errors** - Even obviously bad code passes!

## Strict Mode Analysis

With strict type checking enabled, we found:
- **590 total type errors** across the codebase

### Top Issues

| Error Type | Count | Example |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Call to untyped function | 126 | `self._cleanup_if_needed()` |
| Missing return type | 86 | `def reset_stats(self):` → needs `-> None` |
| Missing parameter types | 38 | `def process(data):` → needs `data: str` |
| Unexpected keyword args | 12 | Twisted API mismatches |

### By Directory

Running strict checks on:
- `dns_proxy/` - Main source (most errors)
- `tests/` - Test files
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts

## Hardcoded Constants Analysis

Initial check found **34 violations**, but after improving the checker:
- Removed false positives for percentage calculations (`* 100`)
- Now **26 real violations**

### False Positives Fixed

❌ Bad detection:
```python
'success_rate': f"{self.success_rate * 100:.1f}%"  # Not RATE_LIMIT_PER_IP!
```

### Real Issues Found

✅ Actual problems:
```python
if self.average_response_time > 100:  # Should be RESPONSE_TIME_WARNING_MS
time_penalty = min((self.average_response_time - 100) / 900, 0.5)
```

These magic numbers (100ms, 900ms) should be constants like:
- `RESPONSE_TIME_WARNING_MS = 100`
- `RESPONSE_TIME_CRITICAL_MS = 1000`

## Recommendations

### 1. Gradual Type Adoption

Start with critical modules:
```ini
[mypy-dns_proxy.health.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = True  # Already stricter!

[mypy-dns_proxy.core.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = True  # Add gradually
```

### 2. Fix Low-Hanging Fruit

Easy wins:
```python
# Before
def reset_stats(self):
    self.stats.clear()

# After
def reset_stats(self) -> None:
    self.stats.clear()
```

### 3. New Constants Needed

For the health monitoring thresholds:
```python
# dns_proxy/constants.py
# Health monitoring thresholds
RESPONSE_TIME_WARNING_MS = 100  # Start penalizing
RESPONSE_TIME_CRITICAL_MS = 1000  # Max penalty
HEALTH_CHECK_WINDOW_SIZE = 100  # Response time samples

# Percentage not a constant!
PERCENTAGE_MULTIPLIER = 100  # Just kidding, don't do this 😄
```

### 4. Type Stub Strategy

For Twisted (no stubs available):
- Use `# type: ignore[misc]` on decorators
- Create minimal stubs for commonly used APIs
- Or switch to `twisted-stubs` when available

## Conclusion

The codebase is in decent shape for a legacy project:
- Constants are mostly centralized
- Some false positives in detection
- Type coverage can be added gradually
- 590 strict errors is manageable (many are repetitive)

The permissive mypy config is doing its job - allowing gradual adoption without blocking development!
