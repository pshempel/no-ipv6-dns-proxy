Description: DNS CNAME flattening proxy with configurable IPv6 handling
 DNS Proxy is a high-performance DNS proxy that flattens CNAME records
 to A records, with configurable IPv6 record handling, and provides 
 intelligent caching. Built with Twisted for maximum performance and reliability.
 Supports multiple upstream DNS servers for high availability.
 .
 Key Features:
  * CNAME Flattening: Automatically resolves CNAME chains to final A records
  * Multiple DNS Servers: Configure multiple upstreams with automatic failover
  * Configurable IPv6: Choose IPv4-only or dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) responses
  * High Performance: Handles 500-1000+ DNS queries per second
  * Intelligent Caching: TTL-aware caching with configurable limits
  * Security: Privilege dropping, secure defaults
  * RFC Compliant: Follows DNS standards and best practices
  * Multi-Architecture: Runs on ARM64, AMD64, and other Linux architectures
  * Production Ready: Systemd integration, logging, monitoring
  * UDP and TCP Support: Handles both small and large DNS responses
  * Dual-Stack Support: Works independently of system bindv6only setting
