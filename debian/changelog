    - FIXED: TTL handling respects DNS TTLs up to 24 hours (was capped at 300s)
    - FIXED: Cache cleanup no longer runs on every get() (major performance boost)
    - ADDED: Negative caching for NXDOMAIN responses
  * Code quality improvements:
    - REFACTORED: All large functions split into focused helpers (<50 lines each)
    - ADDED: Comprehensive constants.py for all hardcoded values
    - IMPROVED: Better error handling and logging throughout
  * Development enhancements:
    - ADDED: Test scripts for running from repository without installation
    - ADDED: Multiple test configurations for different scenarios
    - ADDED: Comprehensive testing documentation
  * Configuration improvements:
    - IDENTIFIED: Multiple DNS server support possible (future enhancement)
    - IMPROVED: Configuration documentation and examples

  * Major bug fixes and feature improvements
  * CRITICAL: Fixed SERVFAIL errors caused by DNS payload type mismatches
  * FIXED: IPv6 CNAME flattening now works correctly
  * FIXED: Both A and AAAA queries now support CNAME flattening
  * ENHANCED: Two distinct service modes now fully operational:
    - IPv4-only CNAME flattener (remove-aaaa = true)
    - Dual-stack CNAME flattener (remove-aaaa = false)
  * IMPROVED: Comprehensive Makefile with better clean targets
  * IMPROVED: Eliminated redundant IPv6 processing sections
  * IMPROVED: Better error handling and logging
  * IMPROVED: Variable name consistency fixes
  * PERFORMANCE: Both service modes handle 500-1000+ QPS
  * TESTING: Verified on production domains (Netflix, etc.)
